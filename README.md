It is a simple asynchronous and non-blocking web interface for Program AB. Program AB is the reference implementation of the AIML 2.0 draft specification. 
AIML is a widely adopted standard for creating chat bots and mobile virtual assistants like ALICE, Mitsuku, English Tutor, The Professor, S.U.P.E.R. and many more. 
Program AB was developed by Richard Wallace (contact info@alicebot.org) and first released in January, 2013. More info about Program AB: https://code.google.com/archive/p/program-ab/.
